### Twitter Sentiment Analysis

This repository contains code and analysis for conducting sentiment analysis on Twitter data. The analysis aims to uncover insights into the sentiment distribution and prevalence of topics discussed on Twitter, particularly focusing on gaming-related entities.

#### Overview:

In this project, we utilize Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit), and VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) to perform the following tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning and preprocessing the Twitter dataset to remove irrelevant information, handle null values, and prepare text data for sentiment analysis.

2. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - Utilizing the VADER sentiment analysis tool to assign sentiment scores to tweets, categorizing them as positive, negative, or neutral based on their compound scores.

3. **Visualization**:
   - Creating visualizations including pie charts, bar graphs, count plots, and word frequency analyses to illustrate sentiment distribution, prevalent topics, and common words used in the dataset.

4. **Key Insights**:
   - Drawing conclusions from the analysis to identify trends, sentiment patterns, and prevalent topics discussed on Twitter. Insights include the prevalence of gaming-related discussions, sentiment analysis of specific gaming entities (e.g., Assassin's Creed, Madden NFL), and sentiment distribution across various topics.

#### Contents:

- **data**: Contains the Twitter dataset used for analysis.
- **code**: Python scripts for data preprocessing, sentiment analysis, and visualization.
- **README.md**: Documentation providing an overview of the project, instructions for running the code, and key insights drawn from the analysis.

#### Usage:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the `code` directory.
3. Run the Python scripts in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook) to execute the analysis.
4. Refer to the README.md for detailed instructions and insights derived from the analysis.

#### Conclusion:

This project provides valuable insights into sentiment distribution and prevalent topics discussed on Twitter, particularly within the gaming community. By leveraging sentiment analysis and visualization techniques, stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of user sentiments, identify areas for improvement, and strategize their social media engagement accordingly.
Special thanks to the data source from which the Twitter data was obtained, contributing to the analysis conducted in this project. Additionally, gratitude to the project creator, [Hrithik Kumar], for compiling and organizing the analysis code and insights.
